# Jai VR Demo

## About the project
This project is a work in progress. Jai, OpenGL and the Oculus SDK are used in this project.

You can currently walk around the virtual room, move and rotate with the controllers. Once I got this working, I realized I had alot of physics reading to do.

## Running the application
### Requirements
Meta Quest 2, along with the Windows application.

You can run the demo by either double clicking the .exe under the "run_tree" directory or running the following command:

```bash
.\run.bat
```

## Building
Unfortunately jai isn't released to the public just yet. So if you don't have the compiler, you're out of luck!
Otherwise you just do:

```bash
.\build.bat
```
